#Everything in a vector contains objects of the same class. 
#The only exception is a list which is represented as a vector but

#NaN is an undefined value i.e. not a number.

# The general rule in R is that the concatenate function, will kind of create the least common 
# denominator vector so, will not give you an error but what will happen is that 
# it will coerce the vector to be the, the class that's kind of the least common denominator.

y <- c(1.7, "a")

# So here, in the first example: I've got in trouble concatenating number 1.7 and 
# letter a, so clearly these are not in the same class one is numeric, and the 
# other is character. So the least common denominator here, is going to be character. 
# And so we're, so what you're going to get is that y is going to be a character vector, 
# where the first element is going to be the string 1.7 and the second element's going
# to be the, the letter A

#So factor is a special type of vector, which is used to create, to represent categorical data. 
#So, and there's two types of factor, there is unordered or ordered, so you can think of this 
#as being, as storing data that are. Have labels that are categorical but have no ordering, 
#so for example male and female. Or you can have ordered factors which might represent 
# things that are ranked. So they have an order, but they're not numerical, for example you 
# know, in many universities you'll have assistant professors, associates professors, and 
# full professors. 
  
x<-factor(c("yes", "no", "yes"), levels=c("yes", "no"))

#The order of the levels in the factor, can be set using the levels argument in factors.

table(x)

# And so, there's a function in R called is.na which is used to test objects to see if they are 
# NA. To see if they are missing values in that object. There's another function called is.nan 
# which is used to test for NANs. 

# The data frame is a key data type used in R and it's used to store tabular data. 
# Data frames can be created by calling most often calling the read.table, 
# the read.csv function and we'll get into that a little bit when I talk about reading data into R. And you can also create a matrix from a data frame by calling the data.matrix a function. Now, you can't if you have a data frame that has many different types of objects, and then if you coerce that into a matrix, it's going to force so each object to be coerced so that they're all the same.

# So there are a few principle functions that we're going to talk about for reading into R. 
# The first two are read.table and read.csv and these are for reading tabular data. 

x <- read.table("hey.txt")

# And they are probably the two most commonly used functions for reading data into R. These functions 
# read text files that, that contain data that are stored in kind of rows and columns type 
# of format and return a data frame in R. The function read lines is for reading lines of a text
# file so this, this can be any type of file really, it just gives you text in a, as a character 
# vector in R. 

# Note: If there's no comment lines in your file. Then just set the comment char to be 
# the comment.char is meant to be blank. So just an empty quote there.

# You can make R run twice as fast by specifying the class of each of your columns. Quick way:
initial<-read.table("datable.txt", nrows=100)
classes<-sapply(initial,class)
tabAll<-read.table("datable.txt",colClasses=classes)

#Lesson 1
#A vector is a collection of numbers.
#When carrying out calculations like:

z <- c(2,4,5)
z*2+100

#Then essentially R is recycling the 2 to make a vector of 2s and the 100 to make
#a vector of 100s. In other words: z*c(2,2,2)+c(100,100,100)

#Lesson 2
# In this lesson, you'll learn how to examine your local workspace in R and begin
# to explore the relationship between your workspace and the file system of your machine.
# Because different operating systems have different conventions with regards to
# things like file paths, the outputs of these commands may vary across machines.


#Get working directory
getwd()

# Some R commands are the same as their equivalents commands on Linux or on a
# Mac. Both Linux and Mac operating systems are based on an operating system
# called Unix. It's always a good idea to learn more about Unix!

#List all the files in your working directory using list.files() or dir()
list.files() 

#This is used to see the arguments of the list.files() command
args(list.files)

#Creates a file in your current working directory
files.create("mytest.R")

#Renames a file from x to y
file.rename(from,to)

#Create a directory in the current working directory called "testdir2" and a
#subdirectory for it called "testdir3", all in one command by using dir.create()
#and file.path().
dir.create(filepath('testdir2','testdir3'), recursive=True)

# Subsetting
# Single square bracket always returns an object of the same class as the original.
# So the subset a vector, you're going to get back a vector.

# There are two logical values in R, also called boolean values. They are TRUE
# | and FALSE. In R you can construct logical expressions which will evaluate to
# | either TRUE or FALSE.
# 
# Just like arithmetic, logical expressions can be grouped by parenthesis so that
# | the entire expression (TRUE == TRUE) == TRUE evaluates to TRUE.
# 
# | The next operator we will discuss is the 'not equals' operator represented by
# | `!=`. Not equals tests whether two values are unequal, so TRUE != FALSE
# | evaluates to TRUE. Like the equality operator, `!=` can also be used with
# | numbers. Try writing an expression to see if 5 is not equal to 7.
# 
# Lets take a moment to review. The equals operator `==` tests whether two
# | boolean values or numbers are equal, the not equals operator `!=` tests whether
# | two boolean values or numbers are unequal, and the NOT operator `!` negates
# | logical expressions so that TRUE expressions become FALSE and FALSE expressions
# | become TRUE.
# 
# | Lets look at how the AND operator works. There are two AND operators in R, `&`
# | and `&&`. Both operators work similarly, if the right and left operands of AND
# | are both TRUE the entire expression is TRUE, otherwise it is FALSE. For
# | example, TRUE & TRUE evaluates to TRUE. Try typing FALSE & FALSE to how it is
# | evaluated.
# 
# | The OR operator follows a similar set of rules. The `|` version of OR evaluates
# | OR across an entire vector, while the `||` version of OR only evaluates the
# | first member of a vector.
# 
# 5 > 8 || 6 != 8 && 4 > 3.9
# [1] TRUE
# 
# | Lets walk through the order of operations in the above case. First the left
# | and right operands of the AND operator are evaluated. 6 is not equal 8, 4 is
# | greater than 3.9, therefore both operands are TRUE so the resulting expression
# | `TRUE && TRUE` evaluates to TRUE. Then the left operand of the OR operator is
# | evaluated: 5 is not greater than 8 so the entire expression is reduced to FALSE
# | || TRUE. Since the right operand of this expression is TRUE the entire
# | expression evaluates to TRUE.
# 
# | The function isTRUE() takes one argument. If that argument evaluates to TRUE,
# | the function will return TRUE. Otherwise, the function will return FALSE. Try
# | using this function by typing: isTRUE(6 > 4)
# 
# | xor() function stands for exclusive OR. If one argument evaluates to TRUE and
# | one argument evaluates to FALSE, then this function will return TRUE, otherwise
# | it will return FALSE. Try out the xor() function by typing: xor(5 == 6, !FALSE)
# 
# To see which elements of ints are larger than 5 type: ints > 5

ints<-sample(10)
ints

#FUNCTIONS

# Functions usually take arguments which are variables that the function operates
# | on. For example, the mean() function takes a vector as an argument, like in the
# | case of mean(c(2,6,8)). The mean() function then adds up all of the numbers in
# | the vector and divides that sum by the length of the vector.
# 
# | If you want to see the source code for any function, just type the function
# | name without any arguments or parentheses. Lets try this out with the function
# | you just created. Type: boring_function to view its source code.
# 
# Example of a function:

my_mean <- function(my_vector) {
  sum(my_vector)
  length(my_vector)
  mean1<-sum(my_vector)/length(my_vector)
}

# Next, lets try writing a function with default arguments. You can set default
# | values for a functions arguments, and this can be useful if you think someone
# | who uses your function will set a certain argument to the same value most of
# | the time.
# 
# Youre going to write a function called "remainder." remainder() will take
# two arguments: "num" and "divisor" where "num" is divided by "divisor" and
# the remainder is returned. Imagine that you usually want to know the remainder
# when you divide by 2, so set the default value of "divisor" to 2. Please be
# sure that "num" is the first argument and "divisor" is the second argument.
#
# Hint #1: You can use the modulus operator %% to find the remainder.
#   Ex: 7 %% 4 evaluates to 3. 
#
# Remember to set appropriate default values! Be sure to save this 
# script and type submit() in the console after you write the function.

remainder <- function(num, divisor = 2) {
  value=num%%divisor
  value
}

#To return the arguments of your function type:
args(remainder)

#Anonymous Function
evaluate(function(x){x[length(x)]}, c(8, 4, 0))

#Did this work?lol
